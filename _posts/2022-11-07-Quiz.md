I took the quiz on Monday and felt quite confident about it. On Tuesday, I checked the score and discovered that I had gotten a 44/50 score. This score was brought about by the failure of my mental abilities in six questions. The first one was a question about a video game in which I did not read the question well enough and did not see that I was meant to select two options. The second question was related to lists and data abstraction. I messed up this problem as I did not fully understand the question and was forced to select a random answer and hope for the best. The third question was involving electric units and math in general. I again did not fully understand and botched the math in this, ruining the answer. The fourth question was about the internet and transmission and I was in the wrong as I made a silly mistake in understanding how the internet worked and the fact that information could be received by a device in any order for using the internet. The fifth and sixth questions were destroyed by my simple mind due to silly mistakes.
