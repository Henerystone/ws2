<p>The video talks about stress in a college environment and how to relive the stress that occurs. Stress is most common in college students due to the fact that they are ovewhelmed and anxious. To relive stress, one must take a break from their daily life and take some time to do what one loves. I personally like to take time to read a book or play video games. This helps me relax and destress myself</p>
