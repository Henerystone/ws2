When a computer boots up, a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started. This kernel provides a shell that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands. Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process. To activate the shell directly, users will run a "terminal" through the Desktop, VS Code or activate "console" while on a cloud computer like AWS.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/images/bash.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/images/bash.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Vocab</title><link href="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/16/Vocab.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vocab" /><published>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/16/Vocab</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Algorithm: At its core, an algorithm is really just a generalized, conceptual solution to a problem that can later be implemented in some real-world form like a computer program.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Extra Credit Notes</title><link href="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/16/Extra-Credit-notes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Extra Credit Notes" /><published>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/16/Extra-Credit-notes</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kathyleen Beveridge:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Night At The Museum</title><link href="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/16/Night-at-the-Museum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Night At The Museum" /><published>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/16/Night-at-the-Museum</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Night at the Museum, we explored the exciting world of computer science and art in a fun presentation form. One of the best projects I saw was a computer science project that used APIs to run an Alarm Clock with a stopwatch and time relevant to many different time zones. The most exciting thing about this project was that its APIs were actually created by the group itself. This project was a combination of creativity and collaboration. Another project that caught my eye was an art project. In the center of this panel, there is a very detailed scene of a patient and some doctors. This scene is incredibly detailed, looking like a window into another room with this happening.]]></summary></entry></feed>
