When a computer boots up, a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started. This kernel provides a shell that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands. Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process. To activate the shell directly, users will run a "terminal" through the Desktop, VS Code or activate "console" while on a cloud computer like AWS.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/images/bash.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/images/bash.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Vocab</title><link href="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/14/Vocab.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vocab" /><published>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/14/Vocab</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Algorithm: At its core, an algorithm is really just a generalized, conceptual solution to a problem that can later be implemented in some real-world form like a computer program.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quiz</title><link href="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/14/Quiz.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quiz" /><published>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/14/Quiz</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took the quiz on Monday and felt quite confident about it. On Tuesday, I checked the score and discovered that I had gotten a 44/50 score. This score was brought about by the failure of my mental abilities in six questions. The first one was a question about a video game in which I did not read the question well enough and did not see that I was meant to select two options. The second question was related to lists and data abstraction. I messed up this problem as I did not fully understand the question and was forced to select a random answer and hope for the best. The third question was involving electric units and math in general. I again did not fully understand and botched the math in this, ruining the answer. The fourth question was about the internet and transmission and I was in the wrong as I made a silly mistake in understanding how the internet worked and the fact that information could be received by a device in any order for using the internet. The fifth and sixth questions were destroyed by my simple mind due to silly mistakes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Night At The Museum</title><link href="https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/14/Night-at-the-Museum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Night At The Museum" /><published>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://henerystone.github.io/ws2/2022/12/14/Night-at-the-Museum</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Night at the Museum, we explored the exciting world of computer science and art in a fun presentation form. One of the best projects I saw was a computer science project that used APIs to run an Alarm Clock with a stopwatch and time relevant to many different time zones. The most exciting thing about this project was that its APIs were actually created by the group itself. This project was a combination of creativity and collaboration. Another project that caught my eye was an art project. In the center of this panel, there is a very detailed scene of a patient and some doctors. This scene is incredibly detailed, looking like a window into another room with this happening.]]></summary></entry></feed>
